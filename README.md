Interactive command line interface to interact with yt-dlp. Tetsed on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

Thanks for checking this out.

I though I would write small script to do a few things with yt-dlp and give other new users to Linux to experiment with the code and just have fun. This is not a do all but only hosts a few fun items yt-dlp has to offer. Can you do these things with other software? Yes you can, but what fun would that be. yt-dlp is amazing and you really need to read the man pages to get a full grasp of what this tool can do.
I left extra menus to add things and to expand what you thought would be important to you. Please enjoy and any comments would be appreciated.

See the comments in the script and this may help you with any questions.
